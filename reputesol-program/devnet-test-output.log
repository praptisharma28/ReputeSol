Found a 'test' script in the Anchor.toml. Running it as a test suite!

(node:44105) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/praps/Downloads/ReputeSol/reputesol-program/tests/reputesol-program.test.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/praps/Downloads/ReputeSol/reputesol-program/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
